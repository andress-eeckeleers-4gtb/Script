            <h2>Inleiding</h2>
            <p>De Ford Focus is een compacte middenklassenauto gemaakt door de Amerikaanse autofabrikant Ford. De Focus is een model dat op bijna alle markten waar Ford actief is wordt verkocht. De Focus werd in 1998 op de markt gebracht in Europa, en is vanaf 2000 verkrijgbaar in Noord-Amerika. In Europa, Zuid-Amerika en Zuid-Afrika verving de Focus de Ford Escort, in AustraliÃ«, Nieuw-Zeeland en Japan verving hij de Ford Laser. In 2001 en 2002 was de Focus de best verkochte auto ter wereld. Op de Detroit Motor Show presenteerde Ford in januari 2010 de derde generatie van de Ford Focus, waarvan de verkoop in 2011 begon.

                The Mk 2, codenamed C307, uses the Ford C1 platform which is shared with the Volvo S40, V50 and C70, Mazda3 and Focus C-MAX. Ford calls this platform sharing programme "Global Shared Technologies".

The basic suspension design, which contributed much to the Mk 1's success, was carried over largely unchanged from its predecessor which, along with a 10% stiffer bodyshell, offers a better ride according to Ford. The same body styles as the Mk 1 Focus were offered, though the saloon did not appear until mid-2005.

The Focus Mk 2 is much larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor with a 25 mm (1 in) increase in wheelbase 168 mm (6.6 in) longer. It is 8 mm (0.3 in) taller and 138 mm (5.4 in) wider. As a result, the interior and boot space have increased. New technologies include a KeyFree system, a solar-reflect windshield, adaptive front lighting, Bluetooth hands-free phones and voice control for audio, telephone and climate control systems.

It also features either a Durashift 6-speed manual, Durashift 4-speed automatic transmission, the all-new Durashift advanced manual transmission or just the standard manual.

The perceived build quality and finish of the interior was another important step up from the Mk 1 - an area where the original car was criticized in comparison to the Volkswagen Golf Mk4 which had defined a much higher standard for the class overall. As a consequence, the Mk 2 featured a padded, soft feel dashboard, damped action for the glovebox, interior grab handles, chrome finish interior door handles, more positive action switchgear, and with better attention paid to material quality and overall finish compared to the Mk 1.

Stylistically, the Mk 2's styling features the same design language found in the Mondeo and Fiesta. Although still recognisable as a Focus the new car uses styling features from the abandoned B-Proposal for the original Focus which never reached production.

                The Focus Mk 2 was also built in Silverton, South Africa for export to Australia and New Zealand. However shortly after launch, Ford New Zealand surrendered its supply to satisfy Australia's high demand, and now receives vehicles from the German factory in Saarlouis. In 2006 the Mk 2 made its debut in the Americas with its launch on the Mexican market as the 4-door saloon or the sporty 3-door in ST trim. The Mk 2 Focus is now available alongside base versions of the Mk I model in some other markets worldwide such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. In Argentina, the Mk 1 Focus was built alongside the Mk 2 in the Pacheco Factory until 2008, and was discontinued in 2010, when the Mk 2 finally replaced it.

In the U.S. and Canada, the Mk 1 Focus was offered in a redesigned form as either a saloon or coupe, the hatchbacks and wagon having been dropped after the 2008 redesign. Sales of the coupe model have been only a small fraction of the previous 3-door hatchback, despite rising sales of the Focus saloon and compact cars in general.
